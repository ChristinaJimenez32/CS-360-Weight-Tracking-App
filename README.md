# CS-360-Weight-Tracking-App
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

Slim Slice the weight tracking app I devloped is met to be a weightt tracking diary. The user will log in their weight each day. They can delete, view, updated, or add weight entries. The user can also request to be sent an SMS nottification when there goal weight is reached. This appp was meant to allow users to view weight gain or weight loss progress and consistently log weight for each day.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I needed various screens to make app easily navigable and digestible. I had log-in screen, create account screen, weight diary screen, SMS notification screen, user details screen. I decided to implement a drawer to allow the user to easily navigate throught the application and reach their desired screen. I decided to base my design off of other popular apps which use drawers, have seperate screens for account updates, and have easily recognizable vector assets. I decided to do this to faciliate the user interaction with the design.



How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I decided to use an iterative approach. I decided to test constantly and change my app tomake the interface friendly or to properly add fucntion to a fetaure. I also made a plan and depicted classes, methods, attributes for each activity and how each activity would interact with classes.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I tested using the emulator. This was one of my important and time consuming steps. I had to ensure that each feature worked accordingly. It revealed flaws in my design being logic or design. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

At first I struggled with the database helper, I struggled retrieving data, but I used external resources. I really used android for devlopers to research how to implement features. 


In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think my design was very strong and considered the users. I think my main goal was for the users to be comfortable using the app and to easily understand each feature that the app offered, and not have questions about what a ceratin features is for.
